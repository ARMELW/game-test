# Test Summary - Counting Machine Game

## Date: 2025-10-20

## Overview
This document summarizes the testing performed on the "Machine √† Nombres" (Counting Machine) educational game and the bugs that were identified and fixed.

## Testing Environment
- **Development Server**: Vite dev server (npm run dev)
- **Browser**: Playwright browser automation
- **Node Version**: 20+
- **Build Status**: ‚úÖ Successful

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue #1: Incorrect Initial Phase (CRITICAL)
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Description**: The game was starting with the wrong introduction sequence, skipping the personalized introduction.

**Root Cause**: 
- File: `src/App.tsx`, line 5
- The code was explicitly setting `store.setPhase('intro-welcome')` which triggered the old/deprecated intro flow
- This bypassed the new personalized intro starting with `intro-welcome-personalized`

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (App.tsx lines 4-5):
const store = useStore.getState();
store.setPhase('intro-welcome');

// AFTER (removed):
// Lines removed - using store's default phase initialization
```

**Impact**: 
- Game now properly starts with the personalized introduction
- User is greeted with "Comment tu t'appelles?" (What's your name?)
- Intro flow follows the intended pedagogical sequence

---

### Issue #2: Missing Input Field (CRITICAL)
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

**Description**: The input field for entering the player's name was not appearing on the initial load, even though the instruction text asked for it.

**Root Cause**:
- File: `src/store.ts`, line 168
- `showInputField` was initialized to `false`
- When the store creates itself with `phase: 'intro-welcome-personalized'`, the `setPhase()` function is never called
- Therefore, the logic in `setPhase()` that sets `showInputField: true` (line 227) never executes during initialization

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// BEFORE (store.ts line 168):
showInputField: false,

// AFTER:
showInputField: true, // Set to true since initial phase is intro-welcome-personalized
```

**Impact**:
- Input field now properly displays on game start
- Users can enter their name or skip the step
- "‚úì Continuer" button is visible and functional

---

### Issue #3: Missing Logo Asset (MINOR)
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT FIXED (Non-critical)

**Description**: Browser console shows 404 error for missing logo file

**Details**:
- Missing file: `/counting-machine/assets/logo.webp`
- Error: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)`

**Impact**: 
- Cosmetic only - doesn't affect functionality
- Unity game loads and works correctly despite missing logo
- Low priority

**Recommendation**: Add the logo file or update Unity build to remove the reference

## Test Evidence

### Screenshot 1: Before Fix
![Game in wrong state](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5071b9a-ab58-42cc-a649-15cd808f9957)

**What's wrong**: 
- Game skipped to "tutorial" phase  
- Instruction says "Bienvenue ! Clique sur ‚ñ≥ pour d√©couvrir la machine !"
- Missing the personalized intro with name input

### Screenshot 2: After Fix
![Game with proper intro](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6acf095b-b28f-4396-a768-24c538c60a2a)

- Game starts at `intro-welcome-personalized` phase
- Instruction asks "Comment tu t'appelles?"
- Input field visible with placeholder "Ton pr√©nom (optionnel)..."
- Continue button (‚úì Continuer) present and functional

## Recommendations for Further Testing

### High Priority
1. **Manual Play-Through**: Have someone play through the entire learning sequence to verify all phases work
2. **Unity Interactions**: Test clicking all buttons (‚ñ≥ and ‚àá) on all four rolls
3. **Challenge Validation**: Verify the validation logic for all challenge phases
4. **Help System**: Test the progressive hints and guided mode when user struggles

### Medium Priority  
1. **Browser Testing**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
2. **Mobile Testing**: Verify touch interactions work on mobile devices
3. **Performance**: Monitor for memory leaks during long sessions
4. **Error Recovery**: Test behavior when Unity fails to load

### Low Priority
1. **Add missing logo.webp** to eliminate 404 error
2. **Accessibility**: Check keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. **Localization**: Verify all French text displays correctly
4. **Analytics**: Consider adding telemetry to track user progress

- ‚úÖ Tested the game from initial load
- ‚úÖ Identified critical startup bugs
- ‚úÖ Fixed issues preventing proper game start
