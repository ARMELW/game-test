# Unity Challenge Integration - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented Unity bridge integration that sends challenge target lists to Unity whenever:
1. A new challenge phase is entered
2. The current target changes within a challenge
3. A challenge is reset

## Message Format

Unity receives messages in the format specified in the issue:
```javascript
if (typeof unityInstance !== 'undefined') {
    unityInstance.SendMessage('WebBridge', 'ReceiveStringMessageFromJs', 'ChangeList' + value);
}
```

Where `value` is formatted as: `target1/target2/target3/...`

## Examples

### Example 1: Unit Challenge
When entering `challenge-unit-1` (targets: [3, 5, 7]):
```
Unity receives: ChangeList3/5/7
```

### Example 2: Tens Challenge  
When entering `challenge-tens-2` (targets: [12, 34, 56, 78]):
```
Unity receives: ChangeList12/34/56/78
```

### Example 3: Progressing Through Challenge
```
Initial state: challenge-unit-1 at index 0
Unity receives: ChangeList3/5/7

After completing target 3 (index becomes 1):
Unity receives: ChangeList5/7

After completing target 5 (index becomes 2):
Unity receives: ChangeList7
```

### Example 4: Learning Phase Transitions
When transitioning from one learning phase to another, Unity receives the challenge list for the new phase:
```
learn-units -> challenge-unit-1
Unity receives: ChangeList3/5/7

challenge-unit-1 completed -> challenge-unit-2
Unity receives: ChangeList2/6/8
```

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files

1. **src/unityBridge.ts**
   - Added `sendChallengeListToUnity(targets: number[])` function
   - Formats targets array as slash-separated string
   - Sends to Unity via WebBridge

2. **src/store.ts**
   - Added `sendChallengeToUnity(phase: string)` helper
   - Added `sendRemainingTargetsToUnity(phase: string, currentIndex: number)` helper
   - Modified `setPhase()` to send challenge list when entering challenge phases
   - Modified all target index setters to send remaining targets
   - Modified all challenge reset functions to send full target list

### Challenge Types Supported

All challenge types are supported:
- Unit challenges (1-3)
- Ten to twenty challenges
- Tens challenges (1-3)
- Hundred to two hundred challenges
- Two hundred to three hundred challenges
- Hundreds challenges (1-3)
- Thousand to two thousand challenges
- Two thousand to three thousand challenges
- Thousands simple combination challenges
- Thousands challenges (1-3)

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- ✅ Linting (no errors)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation (no errors)
- ✅ Build process (successful)
- ✅ Message format verification

## Usage in Unity

Unity must have a GameObject named `WebBridge` with a method to receive these messages:

```csharp
// Example Unity C# code
public class WebBridge : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void ReceiveStringMessageFromJs(string message)
    {
        if (message.StartsWith("ChangeList"))
        {
            string targetsString = message.Substring(10); // Remove "ChangeList" prefix
            string[] targets = targetsString.Split('/');
            
            // Process targets array
            // targets[0] = first target
            // targets[1] = second target, etc.
        }
    }
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation is fully backward compatible:
- If Unity is not loaded, messages are silently ignored
- No changes to existing functionality
- Works seamlessly with current code structure
