# Voice Assistant Implementation Summary

## Issue Requirements
The issue requested:
1. Add voice capabilities to the pedagogical assistant
2. Replace setTimeout-based phase transitions with voice completion-based transitions

## Implementation

### Core Changes

#### 1. Text-to-Speech Integration
- Imported and integrated `textToSpeechService` from the existing voice infrastructure
- Configured service for French language (fr-FR) with default voice settings

#### 2. Modified Core Functions

**`sequenceFeedback(first, second?, onComplete?)`**
- Now speaks messages using text-to-speech
- Chains voice completion callbacks for multi-part messages
- Executes `onComplete` callback when all messages finish speaking
- Replaces the old setTimeout-based approach

**`speakAndThen(message, onComplete?)`**
- New helper function for single-message voice sequences
- Speaks message and executes callback on completion
- Simplifies common pattern of speak-then-action

**`updateInstruction()`**
- Now speaks all instruction text automatically
- Ensures instructions are both displayed and spoken
- Applies to all phase transitions

#### 3. Updated Sequences

Replaced setTimeout chains with voice callbacks in:
- `handleIntroNameSubmit` - Welcome sequence with personalized greeting
- `handleIntroMachineResponse` - Machine feedback responses
- `handleIntroFirstClick` - First interaction guidance
- `handleIntroDigitsSubmit` - Digit counting feedback sequences

### Technical Details

#### Files Modified
1. **src/store.ts**
   - Added text-to-speech service import
   - Modified `sequenceFeedback` function signature and implementation
   - Added `speakAndThen` helper function
   - Updated intro sequence handlers to use voice callbacks
   - Modified `updateInstruction` to speak instructions

2. **src/types.ts**
   - Updated `sequenceFeedback` type signature to accept callbacks
   - Added `speakAndThen` type definition

3. **src/voice/** (fixes)
   - Fixed TypeScript errors (type imports, NodeJS.Timeout → ReturnType<typeof setTimeout>)
   - Fixed linter errors (removed `any` types, proper enum mapping)
   - Corrected import paths

#### Key Improvements
- **Natural Pacing**: Transitions now happen when voice finishes, not after arbitrary timeouts
- **Better UX**: Users have time to listen to full messages before next action
- **Accessibility**: Content is now spoken aloud for visually impaired users
- **Consistency**: All messages use the same voice service

### Voice Configuration
- Language: French (fr-FR)
- Rate: 1.0 (normal speed)
- Pitch: 1.0 (normal pitch)
- Volume: 1.0 (full volume)

### Browser Compatibility
Works in browsers supporting Web Speech API:
- Chrome/Edge ✅ (recommended)
- Safari ✅
- Firefox ⚠️ (limited support)

### Preserved Functionality
- Visual animations still use setTimeout for visual timing (intentional)
- All existing functionality maintained
- Backward compatible (works without audio if needed)

## Testing

### How to Verify
1. Start the application
2. Listen for voice output during intro sequences
3. Observe that transitions happen after voice completes
4. Compare timing with previous fixed-delay approach

### Expected Behavior
- Messages are spoken aloud in French
- Phase transitions occur smoothly after voice completion
- No abrupt cuts or timing issues
- Natural conversation flow

## Future Enhancements
- Voice controls (pause, resume, stop)
- User-configurable voice settings
- Visual indicators when speaking
- Multi-language support
- Voice recognition for responses
