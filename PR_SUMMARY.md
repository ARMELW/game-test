# Pull Request Summary: Fix Infinite Re-render Issue

## Issue Description
**Original Issue**: "quand le challenge est initalisé et qu'on clique sur le bouton vert ca fait un leak, infinite rerender"

When a challenge is initialized and the user clicks the green button (△), the application experiences an infinite re-render loop, causing memory leaks and freezing.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
The `useUnity` hook in `src/hooks/useUnity.ts` was creating new function instances on every render:
```typescript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
const lockUnitRoll = (locked: boolean) => {
  if (isLoaded) {
    sendMessage('WebBridge', 'ReceiveStringMessageFromJs', `LockUnit:${locked ? 1 : 0}`);
  }
};
```

These functions were used as dependencies in a `useEffect` in `MachineANombres.tsx`:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ... sync Unity locks logic ...
  lockUnitRoll(lockUnits);
  lockTenRoll(lockTens);
  // ...
}, [phase, columns, lockUnitRoll, lockTenRoll, ...]); // ← Functions recreated every render
```

### The Infinite Loop
1. Component renders → creates new lock functions
2. `useEffect` sees "new" functions in dependencies → runs
3. Effect execution may trigger state updates
4. State update causes re-render → back to step 1
5. **Result**: Infinite loop, memory leak, frozen UI

## Solution

### Code Changes
Wrapped all Unity communication functions in `useCallback` to maintain stable references:

```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed)
const lockUnitRoll = useCallback((locked: boolean) => {
  if (isLoaded) {
    sendMessage('WebBridge', 'ReceiveStringMessageFromJs', `LockUnit:${locked ? 1 : 0}`);
  }
}, [isLoaded, sendMessage]); // ← Only recreate when these dependencies change
```

### Functions Fixed
All 6 Unity communication functions were wrapped:
1. ✅ `changeCurrentValue`
2. ✅ `changeCurrentGoalList`
3. ✅ `lockThousandRoll`
4. ✅ `lockHundredRoll`
5. ✅ `lockTenRoll`
6. ✅ `lockUnitRoll`
